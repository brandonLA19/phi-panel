This site hosts documentation, firmware updates and sample codes for phi-panel serial. Please feel free to explore around.

There is a "How to get started" wiki page that everyone is highly recommended to read.

For newbies, please download the big-show and run it on your arduino with the panel to see what the panel is capable of. Also, the sample code package has lots of practical examples such as enter numbers, passwords, file names, menus etc. You can start your project with the sample code and expand to a whole project!

For returning visitors, please check out the most recent firmware. Occasionally I would like to take suggestions on what kind of functions you would like to see in new releases so please post on my blog (http:/liudr.wordpress.com/phi-panel) with your suggestions. Say you want a function to flash the screen back light and sound the buzzer as a way of alarm, then I think it makes sense to have it, I'll find time to make it happen in later firmware releases.

For even more frequent returning visitors, please consider sharing what you have done with the panel and contributing your arduino code as sample codes for new comers. I'll post your code for download with all your credits intact.
