# Once you have a phi-panel kit #

If you have purchased a phi-panel backpack and or keypad option, you are strongly recommended to read the phi-panel backpack assembly and keypad options document.

If you got a full panel, please read the main documentation for assembly.

Once you have assembled the panel or backpack, please read the main documentation regarding how to use the panel with arduino or any microcontrollers or directly with a computer.
